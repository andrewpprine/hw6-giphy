# Giphy

## Overview

Launches a site that plugs into the Giphy API to search for and return GIFs, while saving user searches. Site is themed around food.

## Function

1. Site loads with five pre-made search buttons. User may click on any button to see 10 GIFs, or may enter a new search term to create a new button to search with.

2. As user adds buttons, those buttons are added to list of buttons at top of page.

## Known bugs

- should search for 50 GIFs and display 10 at a time (until user clicks 'more' button)
- site not optimized for mobile (GIFs do not resize)
